### README.md

You are the biggest contributor to a world-changing Google update that you put on a hard drive. There’s only one problem: your arch-rival hid your hard drive somewhere in their office. You must find it before the timer runs out and your arch-rival presents their idea at the meeting instead. Find the hard drive and escape the room!

### index.html
We used HTML to play music and to run the escape room timer.

### script.js
The main functionality of our program can be found in the mouseClicked() function. 
Our code is made up of many if statements and counters to track what clues the users have found.
We created an object called “Clickable” which stores the coordinates of the rect in which the clue is located. The object has a function that detects collision with the mouse.
We created text alerts to simulate notifications for when the user found a clue

### assets
Our welcome/end screens were created using Canva - we used time to determine when to display the losing screen
We imported ‘clue’ images from the internet that appear in the toolbox that were to help the user connect their clues. (E.g. braille legend, key, fire extinguisher, etc.)
