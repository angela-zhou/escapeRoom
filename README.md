You are the biggest contributor to a world-changing Google update that you put on a hard drive. There’s only one problem: your arch-rival hid your hard drive somewhere in their office. You must find it before the timer runs out and your arch-rival presents their idea at the meeting instead. Find the hard drive and escape the room!
